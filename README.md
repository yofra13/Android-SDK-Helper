### Overview

This project was made with Eclipse, to be sure of the compatibility of the SDK Helper we highly recommand to use this IDE.   

Follow these 5 Step to test Weemo Technologies into a sample application.

### Step 1 - Check Android Developement Tools

Make sure you have Android plug-in installed within Eclipse.

Android Development Tools (ADT) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE that is designed to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which to build Android applications.

ADT extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK tools, and even export signed (or unsigned) .apk files in order to distribute your application.

If you need to install ADT, please check the [official ADT website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html)


### Step 2 - Install Findbugs Eclipse plug-in

FindBugsâ„¢ is a program to find bugs in Java programs. It looks for instances of "bug patterns" --- code instances that are likely to be errors.

While the SDK uses FindBugs, you don't have to install FindBugs to use th SDK. However, you have to install FindBugs to compile and use the Helper.

If you don't have Findbugs on your Eclipse, please download-it and intall-it. 

Follow instruction on projcet website:  [http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/](http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/eclipse/)
